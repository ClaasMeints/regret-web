# ADR 0005: Use Actix as a api-framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a framework to build our api on top of. We have a few options:

- [Actix](https://actix.rs)
- [Rocket](https://rocket.rs)
- ...

## Decision

We will use Actix as our api-framework.
Other Frameworks might be better but by now Actix seems to be the best choice.
Rocket seems discontinued by now.
